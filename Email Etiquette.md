# Tips for Better Email Etiquette.

## 1. Make sure your message is simple and clear. 
Instead of trying to writer longer emails so they appear more important, 
narrow them down and get rid of jargon. Focus on what the person receiving the email is looking for and avoid everything
else. This is especially important because emails are read on mobile phones over desktop computers these days so it takes
longer to scroll down.

## 2. Use proper spelling, punctuation and grammar.
If you are misspelling words in your emails, people will pick that up and it will hurt your reputation and credibility.
If your email provider doesn't have automatic "spell check" then you should 
copy and paste the email text into Microsoft Word to verify that everything is spelled correctly.

##  3. Respond to emails in a timely manner.
After you receive an email, don't tuck it away. The faster you respond, the better. I've learned this from experience
and typically respond immediately especially if it's something really important. The receiver will appreciate the fast
response and you will be perceived as more dependable.

## 4. Make it action oriented.
If you aren't pushing someone into action through your email, then what's the point of even writing one? Your goal 
should be to end your email with an "action item" so that the receiver knows exactly what to do 
after reading it.

## 5. Beware of the "reply all" button.
Try not to hit "reply all" after receiving an email unless you're positive that the 
entire team needs to have that information. You don't want to waste anyone's time because they are probably occupied with 
their own projects.

## 6. Make the subject line grabbing.
Your co-workers receive a lot of email so make sure your email stands out and they read it.
People browse subject lines so concentrate on making your subject line interesting and appealing to the people you are sending
the email to.

## 7. Know your audience.
If you're emailing a co-worker who is also a friend, then you can be more casual than if you're 
emailing an executive you've never met before. It's important that you aren't too casual though because your friend could
potentially forward your email to someone who you haven't met yet and that could appear unprofessional.

## 8. Use an "out of office" reply when necessary.
When you're on vacation or in training, always make sure you have an away 
message so that people know where you are and who to contact in your absence. This not only looks professional but can help
you defer some requests to others who can support you and solve problems on your behalf.

## 9. Review the email before you send it in the first place.
If you read your email at least twice before you send it, you will
naturally send better emails. Those who just fire off emails without reviewing them first usually make mistakes and look bad in
the process.

## 10.Choose an Appropriate Ending
Sometimes it's hard to know how to end an email message. Here are a few suggestions, based on the situation:

**Thanks or Many Thanks**: If you're asking a favor.

**Cheers**: If you want to wish the recipient good cheer.

**Love or Hugs**: If you love the recipient.

**Best or Warmly**: If you like the recipient.

**Sincerely**: If your message is formal.

**Best Regards or Kind Regards**: If you want to maintain a formal business tone.

## 11.Let the Sender Know Their Message Has Been Received
Email messages can get lost in the mail or in the spam filter. As a courtesy, especially with important messages 
(such as those with attachments or having to do with deadlines), write a short note to let the sender know their
message has been received. For example, if your boss sends you a new project to work on, reply with, "Got it, I'll
get started tomorrow."
